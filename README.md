# RL-Racecar

This project is a coursework (84%) that is part of the Reinforcement Learning module I took in my final year of University.

I edited the notebook so that only the essential parts are shown:
  - A description of the environment and the objective
  - A visualisation of an untrained agent (the racecar)
  - A visualisation of a trained agent
  - And the average learning curve of my agent implementation

Simply run the cells in order to see it working.
